v.	It is used in order to add more to the behavior of methods.
vi.	In method overloading, there is no need of more than one class.

ii. Whereas method overriding is a example of run time polymorphism.
iii.Whereas in method overriding, inheritance always required.
iv. Whereas method overriding is done between parent class and child class methods.
