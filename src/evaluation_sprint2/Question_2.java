//What do you understand by “Java Strings are immutable”.
//Explain the advantages and disadvantages of immutability of
//Strings.

/*
* Answer :-
* String class in Java is immutable. The meaning of immutable means unchangeable or unmodifiable.
* That means if we once create a string object with the value we are not allow to perform any changes in that object.
* In other words, we cannot modify the value of the string. But if we try to change with the new value , a new string object
* will be created by storing a new value.
* So, we cannot perform any changes with the existing string object. This non-changeable behaviour is nothing but an immutable in Java.
